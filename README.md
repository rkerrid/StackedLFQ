# About
A collection of tools to process data from SILAC experiments analyzed in DIA mode.  

# Usage
This package contains modules that can be used to process the report.tsv generated by DIANN with SILAC settings. 
The pipeline module works by:
1) Filtering the report.tsv
2) Formatting the file so that SILAC precursors are in the same row and their total intensity as well as ratios are calculated
3) These ratios are rolled up to the protein level and a single channel mask is generated if no ratio can be calculated
4) To calculate protein intensities, the formated file is passed to directLFQ for normalization (https://github.com/MannLabs/directlfq), these normalized intensities are 'unstacked' according to the protein ratios resulting in normalize light and pulse protein level information.




## Installation

Follow the steps below to install the package:

First clone the repository to your directory - git clone https://github.com/rkerrid/silac_dia_tools_1.0.git

Then with conda:

1. **Create a new conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create --name myenv python=3.9
   ```
   
2. **Activate the conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```

3. **Navigate to the folder where the package was cloned:**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/package
   ```
   
4. **Install the package:**
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

> **Note:** There are some known bugs related to the path configurations for certain JSON files. Work is in progress to resolve these issues.



## DIANN Settings before beggining pipeline
Requires a report.tsv file generated by DIANN version 1.8.1 using the following SILAC settings (choose SILAC labels relevant for your experiment):
